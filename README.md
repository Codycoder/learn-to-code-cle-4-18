# Learn to Code
#### Build IT with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

---

## Goals
* Introduction to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (frontend development)
* Learn enough to know how to ask questions and keep learning
* Create a working personality quiz you can share with your friends!

---

## Getting Started
We are going to work ONLINE in Code Pen -- no need to install anything!

> TODO: Need to create starter project, with PLENTY of comments so students can use references... also include a README in the starter project

* Open my Code Pen
* Fork it to make your own changes
* (brief working tour of CodePen)

---

## Check the Code
* index.html - title, quiz container structure, js/css connection
* style.css - basic page layout and font adjustment
* script.js - event listeners and functions for calculating personality based on options - also super basic personality quiz: based on fav color and fav flavor, what fruit are you?

---

## Customize Content with HTML
* Page Title
* Quiz Heading
* Your Name

---

## Customize Appearance with CSS
* Page Background
* Border Style
* Font color

---

## Customize Quiz with JavaScript
* Add new results and questions and see your personality quiz change!
* (Walk through example of "are you a cat person or a dog person?)

---

## Make it Your Own!
* Adjust the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and see what changes
* Ask me ANYTHING about these languages

---

## On Your Own
* Download from GitHub and copy/paste your work from CodePen in the correct places to keep working on your own
* You'll want a good code editor to work with. These are text editors with syntax highlighting.
* I recommend:
    * Sublime Text
    * VS Code

---

## What you can do
* Add more to your personality quiz
* Learn more about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from w3schools.com
* Use the Mozilla Developer Network

## Thanks for Coming!
* Plug for FlexCode
    * Module 1 is FREE online, so you can get started with backend development as well!
    * You'll be able to see some frontend review activities there
