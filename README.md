# Learn to Code
#### Build IT with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

---

## Goals
* Students will gain exposure to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (frontend development)
* Students will learn enough to know how to ask questions and keep learning
* Students will create a working personality quiz they can share with friends!

---

## Preparation
* Set up a public GitHub repo with JUST the /starter directory so students can download it

---

`< 00:00`

## Before Students Arrive
* Instructor writes/projects instructions for installing Visual Studio Code

---

## As Students Arrive
* Instructor greets students as they enter
* Instructor suggests that students install Visual Studo Code if they don't already have a code editor

---

`00:00 - 00:10`

## Getting Started
* Students download the project from GitHub and unzip it.
* Instructor mentions Git and version control

---

## Getting Excited
* Students double click index.html to open it in their browser.
* Students take the already-working personality quiz.

---

## Getting to Know You
* Students each share:
    * their name
    * their personality quiz result ("What animal are you?")
    * what kind of personality quiz they'd like to create

---

`00:10 - 00:20`

## Getting our Hands Dirty
Two options, depending on the student:
* Students open the folder in Visual Studio Code or another editor
* OR students open `index.html` in their text editor of choice

Instructor gives students a brief tour of each file and the language involved:

|File|Language|Purpose|Contents|
|-|-|-|-|
|index.html|HTML|Structure|title, quiz container, connects js/css files
|style.css|CSS|Appearance|layout, font, colors
|script.js|JavaScript|Behavior|interactive features, function to calculate personality

---

## Next Steps
* Instructor lays out next steps for students:
    * we will open each file and make adjustments
    * we will reload the page to see changes in the existing quiz
    * students can make their own tweaks if they want to start experimenting as we go along
    * after we take a tour of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, students can build their own quizzes

---

`00:20 - 00:30`

## Customize Content with HTML
Instructor gives tour of `index.html`:
* Change page title - describe HEAD vs BODY
* BREAK the &lt;script&gt; and style &lt;style&gt; elements to show how they import JS/CSS
* Change quiz heading - note that there are many built-in elements, like different sized headings
* Students can add their own names: "Made by ___ at We Can Code IT's Learn to Code event"

---

`00:30 - 00:40`

## Customize Appearance with CSS
Instructor gives tour of `style.html`:
* Page Background - note that colors can be named, hexadecimal, RGB/A, etc.
* Border Style - note the shortcut of border-width, border-style, and border-color
* Font color - note that `color` refers to text

---

`00:40 - 00:50`

## Customize Quiz with JavaScript
Instructor gives tour of `script.html`:
* Change the answers, or delete some questions or answers to show the difference.
* Show students how the results are hidden in the HTML and displayed in JavaScript
* Add new results and questions and see your personality quiz change!

`00:50 - 01:00 (END)`

## Make it Your Own!
* Instructor advises students to build their own personality quiz from the starter.
    * Instructor answers questions as students work independently.
* Instructor shares resources to help students keep learning:
    * w3schools
    * MDN
* Instructor advises students of WCCI bootcamps, both in-person and hybrid!
    * Instructor entices students with "real programming" in the backend.
* Plug for FlexCode
    * Module 1 is FREE online, so you can get started with backend development as well!
